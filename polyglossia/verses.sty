%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Usage:
% (use within an Arabic environment)
%
% \setversedim #1#2 		% define the layout (within a group): 
% #1 = length of both half-verses
% #2 = separation distance = length of a connection, if present
% 	Variant:
% \setversedim #1[#2]#3 	% for half-verses of unequal length
% #1 = length of first (=right) half-verse
% #2 = length of second (=left) half-verse
% #3 = separation distance = length of a connection, if present
%
% \halfverses #1#2		% typeset two separated half-verses
% #1 = text of first (=right) half-verse
% #2 = text of second (=left) half-verse
% 	Variant:
% \halfverses #1[#2]#3		% typeset two connected half-verses
% #1 = text of first (=right) half-verse
% #2 = text of connection
% #3 = text of second (=left) half-verse
%
% Alternative (if preferred):
%
% \connverses #1#2#3		% = \halfverses #1[#2]#3
%
% Note: use keshide to attach the connection, if required
% Note: if the verses do not fit on the line, they will be put on
%       two lines, flush to the margins.
