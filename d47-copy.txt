        [Notes on the diary transcriptions:
      
        
        In many of the diaries there are marginal notes in Arabic 
	written in ink by the Baghdad historian Yaqub Serkis sometime 
	after he received them from Alexander Svoboda probably 
	in the late 1920s.  Because these notes are a later 
        addition extrinsic to Joseph Mathia Svoboda's writings, 
	we have gathered them in an appendix where they are listed 
	under unique identifiers--for example [A47_006_09:001]--recording 
        the diary number, place in the diary, and numerical order. 
	In this edition of the diaries, these identifiers are not 
	linked directly to the notes in the appendix.
      
     	
        For some of the diaries, we have prepared minimal notes and 
	glosses as well as extensive word lists.  
        These are available from our website.
      
     
        Images of the original diaries' content are archived 
	on the University of Washington Libraries 
        content management system ContentDM.  See:
	 
     
        http://digitalcollections.lib.washington.edu/cdm/search/collection/iraqdiaries
	 
        
        For many of the diary transcription we have provided 
	live links to the original diary pages 
        invoked by clicking on the page numbers in our 
	HTML display.  Where links are not provided, 
        one may refer to the original diary images in ContentDM.
         
	
        In several of the diaries, pockets in the back covers 
	hold a variety of memorabilia including 
        newspaper clippings, pictures, and souvenirs.  Some 
	of the textual material has been transcribed and 
	is visible in the HTML display.  This was not done consistently 
        but the contents of the pockets are displayed in the images 
	in ContentDM.]

            Alexander, but got very sorry

            month to keep her in the

            remain in Paris but he
            
            should return soon, because
            
            he will be spoilt & he
            
            expends more money

            her about anything else;

                At 8,,45 I landed at Gherrarah
            
            & walked in to Baghdad; the

            arrived yet, two mails are
            
            due, they say that the snow
            
            on the Lebanon have detained
            
            them;~ The Blosse arrived
            
            at 11;
            
          
          
                There is great scarcity
            
            and dearnes of provision in
            
            town, which is worth noting,
            
            it is caused by the scarcity of
            
            rain & the severe cold of this
            
            winter which killed all the
            
            vegetation & pasturage for
            
            sheep & cattle & the price
            
            rose steadily, although there
            
            are great quantity of Grain
            
            stowed away by the dealers
            
            in hopes of getting the price
            
            up & therefore making a good
            
            profit, the Government do
            
            not seem to take any steps to
            
            avoid this, & force the people
            
            & the sellers to dispose of the
            
            provision at a reasonable
            
            price, every kind of food
            
            rose accordingly, The actual
            
            price of provision & Grain
            
            are now selling as

                At 9 1/2 the Postman brought
            
            us two letters from Alexander

            arrived at once which were
            
            detained in Beyrout or Damascus,
            
          
          
                    Alexander is well, he

            Jany; via Bombay; also
            
            my telegram in which I had
            
            told him,

            he is very much touched and
            
            sorry about it, for he thought
            
            that I was angry with him
            
            about something, but he

            in these days & the provision
            
            and Grains are still very dear,
            
          
          
                    The river is falling;

            afternoon, & people continue to

            beastly custum they have in
            
            Baghdad, they are so fond of
            
            visiting houses as if it was a
            
            special duty they must do;

            3 feet since last night, there
            
            is about 5 bricks more to
            
            reach its proper high rise
            
            for irrigation in this part
            
            around Baghdad; This was
            
            the highest it had Attained
            
            last year & people could
            
            not irrigate their cultivation,

                At 11 I went to breakfast &
            
            came back at 12~

                The river is at a Standstill
            
            since noon;
            
          
          
                Our second Mate Mr. Hatfield
            
            has received a letter from
            
            the Agent of S Lynch & co (Mr.
            
            Bottomly) in which they
            
            complain in a very strong term
            
            of his bad behaviour on
            
            board with regard to an Accus-
            
            ation by a Jewess prostitude
            
            made against him in the Office,
            
            and also his neglect once
            
            in delivering the mail at
            
            Basreh in Augt, & was given
            
            to the Khalifah on her way
            
            down, also in leaving the
            
            steamer once when she
            
            was on the point of starting
            
            from Baghdad without
            
            asking her Commander
            
            
            
            and remained behind
            
            on pretence of his being
            
            ill etc, and therefore he
            
            is discharged from the
            
            Company's Service this time

            English Port~ Mr. Hatfield
            
            has decidedly carried this
            
            neglect of duty and the frequent
            
            visits of bad women into his
            
            cabin to excess, Otherwise
            
            he is sober and of good
            
            & mild temper, he certainly
            
            has followed what other
            
            officers are doing in both
            
            steamers~

            this year to come on with it,

            an Austrian Passport as the

            it is to the regret of every body
            
            here Christians, Mahomedans
            
            & Jews because he is one
            
            of the best man in the Turkish
            
            service, a very honest streight
            
            forward man, a just and
            
            wise administrator, he
            
            belongs to the New School

            The present Waly here Atta-
            
            Allah Pasha who is a very
            
            Old Man, Very fanatic &
            
            lazy, & does no good to the
            
            Welfare of the people and
            
            the Country, hated by every
            
            body, but a has a great
            
            influence & being a relative
            
            of the Sheikh ul Islam
            
            
            
            and hates the Mushir in
            
            his internal feelings, being
            
            jealous of him because
            
            every body likes the latter,
            
            has been undermining him
            
            and, the Sultan hates every
            
            person in his service who has
            
            such influence & liberality
            
            with the nation;& frightened
            
            by false rumour being
            
            represented to him, that if
            
            the Mushire is allowed to
            
            be left in Baghdad where
            
            his popularity is gaining
            
            ground, he might eventually
            
            gain his independence by
            
            having all the Army Corps
            
            siding with him as well as
            
            the population, and it might
            
            end by the dismemberment
            
            of Irak Arabia from
            
            the Turkish Dominion,
            
            The population here had
            
            telegraphed to Constple in
            
            begging & praying the Porte
            
            to let him remain here
            
            
            as he has done no end of
            
            good to the country; but
            
            this step it appears has
            
            made things worse, and
            
            the Mushire even did not
            
            like it at all, for this act
            
            will confirm the Waly's
            
            report against him; The
            
            Mushir of Yemen also has
            
            been changed & is appointed
            
            here to replace Rejeb Pasha,
            
            other Mushir's have been
            
            also changed for equal
            
            reasons, The Sultan gets so
            
            alarmed now at the slightest
            
            news he hears, though untrue
            
            and false, at any person

            This is a fine thing Alexander
            
            is doing if what Ibrahim
            
            says is true; I am at a loss
            
            to find out the reality of
            
            this news; but if it is true
            
            Alexander must have been
            
            doing a great fault and
            
            foolishness; unless Ibrahim
            
            has been working at it
            
            all the time before he went
            
            to Vienna – I went with
            
            Rezooki called on Jeboory
            
            conferred with him
            
            
            
            We made out telegrams but
            
            left them to consider, he
            
            came to Rufail to dine
            
            there, I went also, where
            
            I saw Tookyeh & her husband
            
            Rezooki we talked over
            
            the matter, I am mad
            
            from the sorrow & grief on
            
            Alexanders doings,
            
            had no sleep the whole
