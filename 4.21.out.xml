						Mr. Rouet to ask him to
						<lb n="6"/>
						wire to the Prefecture or

						in Paris, and as I saw that

						it only contains the prevention
						<lb n="10"/>
						of his getting married, and
						<lb n="11"/>
						this he cannot do it
						<lb n="12"/>
						firstly because he has not

						<lb n="14"/>
						the rule is in France Austria
						<lb n="15"/>
						etc, &amp; 2d  he cannot do it

						without my consent,
						<lb n="17"/>
						it is useless writing about

						it since he cannot be

						<lb n="22"/>
						telegraph to Beyrout to
						<lb n="23"/>

						Alexander must have
						<lb n="14"/>
						left Paris by that time
						<lb n="15"/>
						as he had told him before so,
						<lb n="16"/>

						<lb n="19"/>
						&amp; 	 sent it to the fathers here

						him the money, it is new

						already 650 frcs that
