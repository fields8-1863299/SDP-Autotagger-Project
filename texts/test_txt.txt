and the other doctors disagreed
with the two Beledyeh doctors,
and they do not believe that the
sickness among the Jews is
a real Plague; because the
desease does not resemble each
other, some die suddenly, other get
buboes & fever & so on ~
  Mr. Rappaport called to see me,
he was glad to find me getting
better; as on Monday the 27th
is the Emperor of Germany’s
Birthday; Mr. Richarz the consul 
is giving a Ball & supper and
50 persons are invited among
whom my niece Alice, also
Antone Marine his wife and
two daughters; Mr. Richarz
has asked Mr. Rappaport to
see me and to find out if he can
invite my son Alexander and
his wife Mary, & there will be
no objection on account of us
being in mourning; We told him 
that they can go if they like, so he
gave the letter of invitation from
Mr. Richarz;~

was very hungry; but I had to 
pay the penalty; I had taken

before dinner in which he had
added some few drops of Senna
I think to stir my bowels as I had
sent to ask him to do so, & by 11
P.M. I feel sick with lots of noise
& wind in Stomach, I had got the 
indigestion, & then I vomited 
all my dinner out with an
offensive smell, I felt relieved,
  By 4 AM my bowels worked
so very loose in great quantity
and very offensive; and again
after ½ hour with pain and
noise in the intestines, I became
so sick that I could not touch
anything, all this was the cause 
of eating a heavy dinner,
