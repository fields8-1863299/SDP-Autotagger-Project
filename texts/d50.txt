      près lesquelles on devrait envoyer des co-

      her Capt Seyd Ali to stop
      
      where he is, until further

      our passengers (we have

      	Light S. Erly & clouds are
      
      coming up from the East
      
      & South ~ The river has
      
      risen about 2 Inches –
      
     
     
      	At 9 ½ a hard shower of
      
      rain came down for about
      
      10 minutes, & remained
      
      cloudy thick & wind
      
      
      from S.W. & West;
      
     
     
      	Our passengers being short of
      
      provisions, many went in
      
      the Launch to the bank and
      
      demanding provisions
      
      so the head of the Zaptyes
      
      sent to get them from
      
      the Village, Bread, fowels
      
      & Badinjan etc, & the
      
      money was paid to Metty
      
      to keep in his charge for
      
      the present;
      
     
     
      	Strong S. Erly wind
      
      blowing; ~
      
     
     
      	At 3 ½ P.M. the Steam
      
      Launch of Lynch & Co came
      
      down also an other Turkish
      
      Steam Launch with few
      
      Zaptyes & the Police Commissioner
      
      Sadek Agha (who used
      
      to be at Coot before) they
      
      landed, & in our Steam
      
      Launch Vartan came,
      
      bring a letter from
      
      Mr. Bottomley to
      
      
      Capt Cowley, telling him
      
      the news & that the quarantine
      
      Authorities wanted the
      
      Steamer to return, but
      
      as the reported sickness
      
      of Cholera had only been
      
      declared on the 5th (the day
      
      of our leaving Basreh)
      
      and that we had landed
      
      passengers on all the
      
      stations on our way up
      
      & therefore having infected
      
      all the river downward,
      
      it was absurd to order
      
      us to return; & Major
      
      Melville the Consul
      
      having wired to the Ambassador
      
      at Constple protesting
      
      against this act, it is
      
      now left so & nothing
      
      has yet been settled
      
      pending further
      
      
      orders; ~ Four Guardians
      
      came also down and
      
      they sent 2 to the Baghdad
      
      & 2 for us; the Steamers
      
      are not allowed to go
      
      alongside the bank as
      
      no Cordon is established
      
      yet;
      
     
     
      	I only received two letters
      
      one from Johny & one
      
      from Artin my nephews
      
      they give me some news
      
      of the sickness at Basreh,
      
      they say that the Pilot
      
      (a native Persian) of the
      
      Gunboat Lapwing had
      
      died at Basreh, but
      
      the merchants receive
      
      telegrams from Basreh
      
      saying that there is
      
      no Cholera there
      
      
      he says Mr. Coidan has
      
      suggested to the Inspector
      
      of the Quarantine Mr.
      
      Cowalaris (who is in Basreh
      
      now) that if it is the
      
      real Cholera, it would
      
      be better to have the
      
      quarantine, established
      
      at Coot, so that the
      
      Mejidieh will be on this
      
      side & the Khalifah
      
      on that side ~
      
     
     
      	I received no letter from
      
      my wife as she is out
      
      encamped at Gherara
      
      & did not know about
      
      the Steam Launch
      
      leaving; Johny &
      
      Artin tell me that
      
      she & all are well,
      
      
     
     
      	We gave them the letter
      
      Bags only, & Lynch’s
      
      letters & manifests &
      
      the Cash Book; I
      
      wrote a letter to my wife
      
      & also to Johny & enclosed
      
      it in his & sent Antone
      
      Marine & others also,
      
     
     
      	We have only the fumigatory
      
      Box & about 3 Zeptyis
      
      lying on the bank; &
      
      all the rest have gone,
      
     
     
      	Lots of passengers have
      
      crossed over to the other
      
      side in the Baghdad’s
      
      boat last night and
      
      went overland to Baghdad
      
      about 20 or 30 ~
      
     
     
      	At 6.15 P.M. the Steam
      
      Launch of SLynch & Co left
      
      Azizieh for Baghdad,

      	At about 2 am, a strong
      
      squall came on, the wind
      
      shifted suddenly to N.W.
      
      blowing with great violence
      
      & thick dust, with thunder
      
      & lightning, & very cloudy

      large sailing boat laden
      
      with grain which was
      
      prevented from going up
      
      yesterday got adrift &
      
      nearly came on top of
      
      us. We run a stern anchor
      
      out & after ½ hour the
      
      squall passed, but kept
      
      blowing a fresh N.W.
      
      & cloudy ~
      
     
     
      	At 7 it came on to rain
      
      for ½ hour, clouds are
      
      
      thick & very thretening;

      	At 2 P.M. the S.S.
      
      Ressafah & Barge came
      
      down from Baghdad, she
      
      anchored above Azizieh
      
      Village; Some of our
      
      passengers wanted to go
      
      back in the Ressafah,
      
      & they were refused, by saying
      
      that they had no orders,
      
      although it is against
      
      the rule;
      
     
     
      	At 3,,25 the Ressafah &
      
      Barge left & passed down;

      fine with a light N.W. breeze
      
      & cool; not a soul on
      
      the bank all went away

      from Lynch ordering us

      A great rejoicing was felt
      
      among the passengers

      on shore, I went off and

      day of our leaving Basreh

      out the declaration, but
      
      that he will not stay till
      
      11 as he had the orders to
      
      start immediately; they
      
      sent to say that the acting
      
      Kaima Kam had not yet
      
      received the orders if we
      
      can wait an hour more,
      
      for the Steam Launch to
      
      get her steam up; We

      flood tide against us;
      
     
     
      	At 10,,20 arrived to the
      
      quarantine station above
      
      the Canal of Garmat Ali
      
      on West bank we rounded
      
      & anchored; The Khalifah
      
      & her Barge loaded alongside
      
      of her is making her
      
      quarantine of 10 days
      
      since Sunday the 15th, also
      
      the Phrat & Barge are
      
      astern of her there are
      
      some Huts erected on shore
      
      for the passengers and
      
      a Dozen of Zaptyes in
      
      their Tents; The Belem
      
      
      of Lynch Brothers came with
      
      their Clerk Hannosh
      
      son of Kass Hanna, he
      
      brough us our letters etc,
      
      & took letters parcels &
      
      provisions etc for the
      
      Khalifah & others, I
      
      sent Henry's letters and
      
      parcels; There is strictness
      
      of quarantine rule at
      
      all we are allowed all
      
      Boats & Belems to come
      
      alongside of us give and
      
      take, only no one is allowed
      
      to come on board, but
      
      there is no quarantine
      
      officials or guards at
      
      all; to prevent this, the
      
      Zaptyes are away in their
      
      Tents & do [strikethrough] not interfere,
      
      the work is awfully
      
      slack, it seems that
      
      no one understands
      
      
      how to carry on their duty,
      
      a Steam Launch came up
      
      with the Inspector of
      
      the quarantine of Baghdad
      
      Mr. Cavallaris & passed
      
      up river, they say he goes
      
      to inspect if there are
      
      no cases of Cholera among
      
      the Arab villagers;
      
     
     
      	As for the Sickness, it
      
      appears that it is very
      
      mild & few cases have
      
      taken place on the banks
      
      of the river, but none yet,
      
      in town, some Beloochi
      
      Watchmen at Lynchs Brothers
      
      Wharfs died about 4 of
      
      them, 2 or 3 cases at Ghirdelan
      
      & few down the river
      
      a Negro Sailor on board
      
      the SS. Lapwing also died
      
      after coming from Basreh,
      
      They have heard of no
      
      
      other cases for the last 4
      
      or 5 days; But the most
      
      amusing Story is, and
      
      it is a fact too, that a
      
      Certain Greek apothecary
      
      in Basreh called Dr. Storaky
      
      in the military service had
      
      been distributing some
      
      sugar plums in a sort
      
      of Bon Bons & Lozenges
      
      impregnated with a
      
      Cholera microbe, by giving
      
      them to a black man
      
      and this had its effect &
      
      caused about 100 deaths
      
      among children & adults,
      
      the Government caught this
      
      Negro man & made him
      
      confess & showed them
      
      the man who gave it
      
      to him, so this doctor
      
      has been thrown into
      
      prison, pending orders
      
      
      from Constple of how he
      
      is to be punished, that
      
      he has also sent a lot of
      
      these Lozenges up river to
      
      other towns as Nasryeh,
      
      Amara Baghdad etc,
      
      and that he has done this
      
      through the instigation
      
      of the late quarantine Doctor
      
     
     
      		who has been
      
      dismissed & left for Constple
      
      by the steamer of Asfar last
      
      voyage we were here, as he
      
      is a Cousin of this Greek
      
      doctor, the case has been
      
      taken up very seriously
      
      in Basreh by the Authorities,
      
     
     
      	We sent our passengers
      
      away; & Boats came
      
      alongside of us to take
      
      the Cargo of Baghdad
      
     
     
      	The steam Launch Asp. of
      
      Lynch Broth came up with
      
      the Post Master & took
      
      the mails; ~ There is
      
      
      a Native Doctor of Constple who
      
      was at Jedda here in the
      
      quarantine station, he came
      
      alongside to our sponsoon &
      
      others from Basreh also Kassim
      
      Khdery & many others &
      
      they say that there is no thing
      
      now at Basreh & no cases
      
      for some days; & the Story
      
      of the Lozenges & the doctor
      
      is all not true, they have
      
      analysed & verified the
      
      Sugar plums & found it safe;
      
     
     
      	Mr. Mayle, in the firm of
      
      Muir Tweedy & afterward
      
      called the Persian Gulf Trading
      
      Company; who was ill
      
      since two months, & went up
      
      with us to Baghdad in July
      
      for a change, & came down
      
      in the Khalifah, then went
      
      up in her in August and
      
      returned, he died on Saturday
      
      (the day before yesterday)
      
      
      & was buried at Maghil
      
      in the new English Cemetry,
      
      built above Maghil by
      
      the Turkish Governt for all
      
      the Europeans; no one
      
      seems to know the cause of
      
      his illness; he looked so
      
      pale & pulled down & has
      
      not recovered since~
      
     
     
      	At 6 P.M. Capt Hanslow

      cargo for us & coal got
      
      adrift & came on top of
      
      us; it is a good thing
      
      that we are in a good
      
      
      place just between the
      
      upper island of Garmat Ali
      
      and the shore, in a narrow
      
      place; the quarantine people

      	At 4,, 20 we stopped at
      
      the Bridge of Gherrarah &
      
      I went in the boat so as to
      
      land & walk to Baghdad
      
      Dr. Ruck was on the bank
      
      & told me not to land but
      
      to come back with him to
      
      the ship, he showed me
      
      at the same time a letter
      
      from Coidan Baghdad
      
      telling him to stop any
      
      steamer or Boats coming
      
      up until further orders,
      
      Dr. Ruck thinks perhaps
      
      it is on account of the death
      
      of Sherif Beg the Taboor
      
      Aghassy of Basreh who was
      
      ill with consumption
      
      
      & his brother Izzet Beg who
      
      went down with us last
      
      trip to bring him up, and
      
      on the way up on board
      
      the Phrat, he died & the body
      
      was landed today at Ctesiphon
      
      & the body taken up in
      
      a carriage brought by
      
      Turkish Officers & taken up
      
      about an hour after the
      
      Phrat had passed up
      
      today at 10 AM;  But Izzet
      
      Beg had obtained a paper
      
      from the Quarantine Doctor
      
      at Coot certifying that Sherif
      
      Beg had died from consumption
      
      We have nothing to do with
      
      that, & we have had no
      
      communication with any
      
      place either the village of
      
      Coot or with the quarantine,
      
     
     
      	So Dr. Ruck wrote to
      
      Coidan & told him that the
      
      Mejidieh has just arrived
      
      she has not a single
      
      passenger, and has her
      
      
      Clean Bill of Health, all
      
      in Order & also Capt Cowley
      
      wrote to Lynch informing
      
      them of our detention here,
      
      Capt Cowley invited Dr.
      
      Ruck to come & dine with
      
      us this evening; He came
      
      at 6;~ At 8 ¼ after dinner
      
      the answer from Coidan
      
      came to Dr. Ruck in which
      
      he tells him that Dr. Ahmed
      
      of the quarantine at Coot
      
      having telegraphed that
      
      Coot being contaminated
      
      and that he has wired
      
      to the Inspector Dr. Cavalliaris
      
      at Basreh enquiring instruction
      
      & that for the mean time
      
      the Mejidieh had better wait
      
      for an observation, the
      
      telegram was urgently sent,
      
     
     
      	What an injustice &
      
      what a humbug, the
      
      Dr. Ahmed knew very
      
      well our position
      
      
      at Coot when he came
      
      up in the Khalifah, we
      
      prevented every person from
      
      coming to the ship either
      
      from Coot or the opposite
      
      shore; even when we
      
      were told that Coot was
      
      not infected & left free,
      
      still we avoided all
      
      communications~
      
      Dr. Ruck went away
      
      at 8 1/2~

      before on the 13th Ulto,
      
      was on the point of
      
      Marching against

      brother Namoos of the
      
      Tribe of Rabia or Amara
      
      but it appears that he
      
      was warned by the Government
      
      to desist & a compromise
      
      which settled the dispute
      
      for the present time, besides
      
      the Rahia Arabs were
      
      collecting themselves &
      
      outnumbered his followers,
      
     
     
      	But later on he collected
      
      about 600 horsemen, and
      
      crossed the river near
      
      Sheikh Saad, where he
      
      was joined by Hassan
      
      el Jendeel, his ally and
      
      subordinate & they went
      
      to attack Gassab Sheikh
      
      of the Magssis & Seraî
      
      to the west of Sheikh Saad
      
      between the lather &
      
      the Haî Canal

      Ghadban's intention
      
      & failure of attacking
      
      the Amara tribes, had
      
      prepared himself to
      
      receive Ghadban having
      
      got a number of the
      
      Montefik Arabs his
      
      friends & ally under
      
      Mohamed the son of

      150 Henry Martini &
      
      had concealed themselves
      
      in ditches dug out on
      
      purpose along their
      
      encampment so when
      
      the Beni Laam horses
      
      charged to their tents &
      
      to the few Magassis
      
      horsemen, they were
      
      received by the fire
      
      
      of Martinis & they killed
      
      some say 50 others say
      
      80 & 45 horses and
      
      had to retreat and went
      
      away crossing the river
      
      at Omeyeh to their territory
      
      This happened about

      tribes were at Coot, but
      
      had arrived too late, it
      
      was arranged & as I
      
      said Ghadban had

      board, took my Passport
      
      etc,; & went on shore to
      
      see Mr. Rappaport, called
      
      on Sister Eliza to take
      
      Johny to introduce him
      
      to Mr. Rappaport; at

      Passport & asked him to write
      
      to Beyrout about my son,
      
      but when he knew my son’s
      
      age in the Passport 18 years
      
      & now he is 23, he told me
      
      that he cannot by the rule
      
      write to the Consul to ask
      
      him to assist my son because
      
      he is obliged to say that he
      
      has not served the military
      
      service & he can never
      
      get a Passport too, also
      
      that his marriage at this
      
      age would not be valid
      
      
      or permitted in the Austrian
      
      law, until he gets to the
      
      age of 32 then he is exempt,
      
      Otherwise he cannot see
      
      how come he write & ask
      
      to be protected or given
      
      him a sort of Passport;
      
      But he will see what he
      
      can do tomorrow until
      
      the Post leaves for Damascus
      
      I left with Johny at 9 I then
      
      called on Mons. De Sarzec
      
      at the Delagate Altmayer
      
      house, I gave him a
      
      list of the stations between

      my Son’s passing etc, I
      
      went to him @ 1 P.M. he
      
      says that he has been trying
      
      to find out some means
      
      so as to be able to write to
      
      the Consul at Beyrout &
      
      let him give Alexander a
      
      Pass or assistance but
      
      he sees that he cannot do
      
      it without risking himself
      
      He has however thought
      
      of wiring to the Government
      
      at Agram in Croatia,
      
      where my Passport had

      via Beyrut, for the cause
      
      of a grave familiar affair
      
      & requests him to wire
      
      so as he can inform the
      
      Consul of Beyrut to let
      
      him pass & assists him,
      
      He made out the telegram

      1900 June
     
     
      	Light Erly breeze & cool
      
      morning~ at 7 AM
      
      I came on board; paid
      
      Some people their wages &
      
      At 8 ½ I went to call on
      
      
      Mr. Rappaport, he told
      
      me that he received the
      
      answer from Agram 4
      
      days after he had wired
      
      and they have allowed
      
      my son to be furnished
      
      with a Pass by the Austrian
      
      Consul of Beyrout on
      
      his arrival there but
      
      only liable until he
      
      reaches Baghdad; I
      
      Spoke to him regarding
      
      the telegram my son
      
      sent me on the 31 May
      
      & which I showed to him,
      
      it which he says that
      
      (as I have copied above)
      
      and Mr. Rappaport told
      
      me that he cannot
      
      give such an attestation
      
      for the cause that he
      
      has not served his
      
      military term, and
      
      
      therefore the law does
      
      not allow a young man
      
      at that age to marry until
      
      he has done his military
      
      service, he overhauled
      
      all the law books, and
      
      could not find any
      
      way to facilitate it,
      
      even it says that persons
      
      contracting such marriage
      
      being liable to a fine
      
      of 1000 florins or an
      
      imprisonment of 6 months,
      
      and even the Consuls
      
      who contract such
      
      marriage are punished
      
      with a fine of 500 Flor
      
      or an imprisonment of
      
      3 months; I was very
      
      sorry & dishearted, after
      
      talking much, he
      
      said that if I would
      
      
      like, that he will wire
      
      to Agram to ask for
      
      leave, & explain the
      
      necessity of its being done,
      
      I agreed, but he also
      
      doubted whether the
      
      answer will be favorable,
      
      so I left him to make
      
      out the telegram & send
      
      it to me;
      
     
     
      	I went to the Office &
      
      got some pounds sterling
      
      from Mr. Bottomley,
      
      & came home;
      
     
     
      	Mr. Rappaport sent
      
      me a letter written by
      
      him in Italian for
      
      me to sign, it is a declaration
      
      from my part saying
      
      that, by the verbal
      
      
      conversation I have had
      
      this morning with him
      
      regarding my son's attestation
      
      for marriage, and I
      
      consented to his wiring
      
      to Agram for instruction
      
      & that I would pay
      
      all expenses etc; so I
      
      signed it, and after an
      
      hour he sent me the telegram
      
      & writes, to me to read
      
      & count the words and
      
      give the money to the
      
      Kawas to have it wired
      
     
     
      	I had written to Rappaport
      
      that should the answer
      
      be unfavorable, I
      
      will wire to my son to
      
      leave at once and
      
      come out here and
      
      
      have his marriage
      
      celebrated in Baghdad,
      
      he answered me that
      
      it will be certainly valid
      
      but illicit by the
      
      Austrian Military law,
      
      by article 50 of the Military
