	Margin Line 1:1902 Jany
	Margin Line 10:H. Hamadi died
	
	I did not leave my bed today
I feel weak & besides it is very
cold outside; I only took
a cup of milk & toast bred
	I sent to ask how H. Hamadi
was and they said that he
was dying; ~
	Marie & Eliza went to take
their hot bath at Antone Marines
Bath in the house; 
	Subsection:26 Sund The 6.32
	Sister Eliza called to see
me and she tells me that
she heard that H. Hamadi
died this morning at about
10 AM; Poor Hamadi I
have had him as my Servant
for nearly 35 years; he was
getting old too, he must have 
been over 70 years; he leaves
2 sons, 3 daughters, 5 children & a wife & 
has no money except the house 
they are living in ~
	I sent Alexander to Dr. Ramsey
today at 1 P.M. to relate to him
what happened to me last night
& if I can use the medicine
he told him that it was all
