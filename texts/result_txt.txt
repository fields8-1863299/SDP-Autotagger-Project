having satisfied &amp; made a
thorough enquiry about the
girl Mary, &amp; was ready to
get married after two weeks
&amp; having made the notice

in the Church and went he
went to the Mairie to do
the same thing, they objected
to the Authorization which I
made at Basreh through an
English Consul that it should
be made by the Austrian Consul
in Baghdad (Don't they see that
in the Authorization itself the
English Consul says that at
the request of the German
Consul of Baghdad, and in
absence of any Austrian Consul
had asked Mr. Wratislaw the
English Consul to Certify my
attestation?) they referred
Alexander to the Austrian Consul
of Paris to whom he went &amp;
was explained that an attestation
should be obtained from
the Austrian Consul of Baghdad
&amp; so Alexander wired
to me on the 31 Ulto; I
also found a telegram from
Alexander dated the 18 Instt
from Paris in answer to
mine last one which

I had left with Eliza to be
sent to him in case an unfavorable
answer comes from Agram

to today, no answer has come
yet) &amp; this telegram my wife
sent on the 14th, which it says;

humbug the Consuls are

an idea of their stupidity;

Duval the Archbishop at

 &quot;instruct 400 leaving 29;

from Amara, she has about

At 2 P.M. I came on board,
I wrote to Mr. Rappaport today
telling him that as I have
received a telegram from my
son from Marseilles telling
me that is leaving on the 29
for Beyrout, I request him
to wire to the Consul General
of Beyrout to furnish him
with a Passport~ He
wrote back to me, enclosing
the telegram, but he only
mentions my son's name
without that of his wife;
&amp; telling me that as he
does not know if he has
been married or not

so as he would have got
her name included in the
Passport; I wrote back to
him at 6 P.M. saying that
as I wish to have the telegram
sent before Alexander's arrival
in Beyrout so as not to have
any difficulty with the Turkish
Authorities &amp; most likely that
he will get married in Beyrout
as I have written to Monseigneur
Altmayer in Mossul to
wire to Beyrout to Monseigneur
Duval to let him do so,
Therefore it would be better
if he can put in the telegram
that the Passport he made
out for either himself or
accompanied by his wife,
[space] I went home at 6 1/2 P.M.
&amp; soon after his Kawass came
to me saying that Mr. Rappaport
wishes to see me after an
hour or so~ I went at
7 1/2 but he was not at home

so I went to my Sister Eliza
&amp; awaited there until he
came, I went &amp; saw him
up on the top of the house,
we spoke about the matter
&amp; so we found the best thing
is to leave the telegram now
until 5 or 6 days more
to await for information
from Monseigneur Altmayer
about his telegram to Beyrout
and as Alexander will
not arrived to Beyrout until

While rounding the point at

wheel got damaged an Arm
&amp; segment bent &amp; broken, we
anchored for epairs; ~
Modte N.W. wind &amp; fine;


On our way down this trip
we met below Zechyeh the Tribe
of Chenana &amp; others (of the Beni
Laam) which had followed
their deposed Sheikh Ghadban
&amp; having flew away to Howeza
(as I have before mentioned here)
and many other of his Tribes
followed him, now the
Chenana wishing to come

back &amp; settle down, but afraid
of coming across the desert
toward Ali Gherbi, have
asked the Government for a
safe conduct, and the Bimbashy
of the Senyeh my friend
Omar Sheriff Beg was sent
down river and procured boats
and ferried them over the
Sweb river below Gorna,
with their families &amp; cattle
they say about 150,000 sheep,
besides cows, camels etc which
I saw crammed in the
desert; but as they cannot
continue their journey on the
East bank on account
of much water &amp; canals,
they wanted to cross and
take the West bank;
and today while we were
here repairing about 20
mashoofs passed down
manned &amp; armed by Shebana
Arabs &amp; with them the
Kaimakam of Kalat Saleh

and Osman son of Yessir
the Sheikh, they went down
to Omar Sherîff &amp; the Chenana
Arab because the Sheikh
Seyhood (who has farmed
the Kesreh &amp; Hafireh opposite
K. Saleh) opposes their
passing through his farmed
land fearing its getting
destroyed &amp; the cultivation
trampled on by this host
of Arabs &amp; their cattle; and
I think they will have to
cross the river Tigris first
to the West &amp; come as far
as here &amp; then recross again
&amp; take the East bank
to avoid the Marshes etc;


At 5,,20 P.m. we finished

I received Henry's letter and
a letter from my Wife, enclosing
a letter from Alexander
dated Alexandria the 30 July.
he says that he was obliged
to go there from Port Said
in the same steamer he came
in from Brindisi the Bosforo

of the Rubatino Copy, without
paying any extra passage as
he had the choice to go either
to P. Said or Alexandria &amp;
the cause of his going to Cairo
is that there are no steamers
going to Beyrout on account
of the quarantine &amp; that there
will be one of the Lloyed going
on the 10 or 12 Instant, so he
thought it would be better
to spend his time at Cairo
instead of P. Said, But
my wife is in a great enxiety
for not having received a
telegram from him from
Beyrout up till the 18th, &amp;
she has wired to Shukralla
Abood for information ~ I
also received a letter from
Abduljibbar Effendi from
Paris dated the 22 July, he
says that he had been looking
for Alexander, &amp; he was told
that he had gone to London,
&amp; he does believe that he

is coming out here &amp; many
other false information he
was given by some people;
he had even gone to see Père
Henry Bernard at Arceul out
of Paris; &amp; he was told that he
knew all about Alexander &amp;
the girl, but as for their marriage
he does not know what has
happened after etc etc;

says,


&quot;	Svoboda Baghdad

&quot;Healthy making ten days

&quot;quarantine, instruct

 &quot;Abood 500 Love;



He does not say when he
arrived, &amp; I was wondering
why he should make 10
days quarantine, since
it was reduced to 48 hours
on those coming from P. Said,
so I went to see Mr. Coidan,
&amp; enquired from him, he looked
over the Order sent from Constple
last trip when I was here,
&amp; it says the 48 hours is
only imposed on those coming
from P. Said after the 10th
Instt, but those coming from
Alexandria to Beyrout
the 10 days is still mentioned,
so Alexander must have
embarked from Alexandria,

&amp; I had settled it through
Abduljebbar the Lawyer
Now he has again

begun to stir up this question,

property next to this little

We are discharging &amp; loading


At 8 1/2 Rufail sent me his

the Mudir of Tapo ;~ I went up

to Yousif Marine at Shaebyeh
where we saw Ali Beg, &amp;
we spent the day &amp; breakfasted
together, it is fine &amp; cool,
Yousif is also packing 10,000 cases
of dates from his own property,


At 4 P.M. we returned, I landed
with Rufail at his house &amp;
Ali Bey went into Basreh;


Rezooki came from the Consulate,
and he broke to me gradually
the sad news which was
wired today by Mr. Livingstone
from Baghdad to Mr. Mackey
here of the death of poor
Captn Cowley on Wednesday
I was so sorry &amp; grieved to hear
it that I could not dine
or sleep at night; I cannot
convince myself the cause

when we left he was getting
better but he must have been
ill for a long time, he was
always getting thinner &amp;
thinner since he came back
from England he never recovered
his health for the last three
years; the diarrhea he had
on his way up last trip must
have been a disentry, for he
was passing blood too;
I have almost always with
him together in these steamers
since he came out in 1866
My diary will show all his
service out here, he must be
about 59 years old or a
year younger than me I
should think; The Mejidieh
&amp; the Malamir here had hoisted
their flag half mast;
Alfred Holland his brother
in law, &amp; Alfred his son here
had not got a telegram about
his death; I dare say that
Mr. Bottomley did not like

to break the news to them,
his son (the eldest) Charley
is in Baghdad he was also
suffering from a slight diarrhea
&amp; he being the second mate
in the Khalifah had remained
behind last trip, the next

Mr. Braine is very dissatisfied
at the manners that Lynchs
are treating, &amp; that is through
Mr. Taylor who is at Ahwaz,
it appears that the latter is
trying to cut down the pay of
all the people employed on
board of these two steamers
Mejidieh &amp; Khalifah and
ruin this Company's name
he has suggested to Lynch
in London the appointment
of Capt Aidy of the Malamir
at the salary of 20 £ as
this man is drawing now
from that vessel, &amp; would
not give 25 £ to Mr. Braine
being the same pay as Captn
Hanslow is getting; The
pay of Capt Cowley was 40 £
but this shall never be given
any more to any new appointed
captain; as the Captain
has no mess money allowed
to him which is 96 Beshlics
(£ 4.), so his pay cannot
be said to have increased

from that of a Chief mate's
pay which is 14 £ &amp; 4 £
for messing; Capt Aidy
does not know the river here
he is not liked by every one,
and does not speak a word
of Arabic &amp; this change I
think will greatly injure
the Company's prestige and
influence in this river; Taylor
is always intriguing with
the affairs of these steamers &amp;
their men~

 [Arabic] of the carriage he travelled yesterday in a mule-litter عربانه سافر امس تختروان ++

   [Arabic] Eliza اليزة ++



I am wondering why &amp;
what is the cause of his detention
perhaps the carriage broke
down, but from Aleppo to Meskeneh
it is so short only about
18 hours &amp; there are no difficult
road or any stones, rocks or
hills it is a plain desert,
perhaps they did not feel so
comfortable in the carriage;

Metty told me that Mr.
Bottomley told him it would
be better to receive all the
Balance of Cash from me
&amp; the Cash Book &amp; write
in it; ~ At 9 Mr. Rappaport
came on board to me,
&amp; asked me to accompany
him to the Waly Namik
Pasha about my affair
of the house, I went

him to outside the Custum
House where he had his
hired carriage, but as I
had not the Title deed
of the small house with me
I sent his Kawass home
&amp; brought it, while we were
waiting in the carriage
in Suk el Harrage &amp; we
then drove on to the Sarai
We went up to the Waly
he was by himself; he
speaks a little Arabic
sufficient to understand
he was very polite and
amiable (as I knew him
12 years ago when he had
gone down to Amara
as Inspector of the Sennyeh)
we spoke good deel about
Amara etc; then Mr.
Rappaport spoke to him
about the purchase of

my little house 10 years
ago, &amp; I showed him the
Title deed, &amp; explained
to him how this man
called Emin is claiming
it as Wakuf, &amp; that
Yacoob (Pasha) Eassayi
is encouraging him to do
so etc etc; he said that
he knew this fellow Yacoob
Eassayi as a bad lot,
he was once a member
in the Mejlis but he
discharged him; he offered
to do all he can &amp; will
speak to the Judge about
the matter, &amp; he wanted
me to write it out the
matter in a sort of Petition
at once &amp; bring it to him
as today there is a Mejlis
&amp; the Kadi will be present
so I left Mr. Rappaport

there, &amp; I hastened back
as quick as possible in
search of my Lawyer
Artin Sinan, after much
search I found him &amp;
we went to Yousif Yaghchi
in Asfar's Khan, and
I asked him to get me the
Petition written quick
before noon; but I saw
that this man is hasitating
and was in a fix and
showed abjections etc, at
last he told me plain
that he cannot now act
as my Lawyer on the ground
that he does possess
his Certificate of Lawyership
&amp; this has only been
revealed now, as the Order
has only been given by

Authority two days ago,
&amp; therefore I must choose
an other Lawyer to defend
my claim; I was [strikethrough]
puzzled &amp; did not know
what to do, &amp; the time
is passing; at last we
went to Kewark Setyan
(the brother of Kirikor whom we
have on board as Engineer
Apprentice &amp; the other brother
is Kapriel whom we saw
in Paris in 1897) to this
man I explained the matter
&amp; he wrote the Petition out
in the name of my wife
(as the Title deed is in her
name) I went &amp; fetched
her seal also 2 G.S.P. for
stamps &amp; I took it at 11
and hastened back to
the Waly (Mr. Rappaport
had gone) I gave it

to him &amp; sat down, he red
it &amp; found it right, he
then wrote on the back
of it to the Tapo Officials
to find out the registration
of the Title deed in their
Books, I then left and
walked away at 11 ¾


I called in the Office to
Mr. Bottomley; he told
me that I should make up the balance
in the Cash Book &amp; give the rest of
the money to Metty to continue
entering every thing in the Cash
Book instead of writing it on
a separate paper; and also
to give him my Cabin to
use as an office &amp; not to lock
it up &amp; take the Key, as if
some accident or fire occurrs
the Cabin will be locked,
I told him how can I take
away all my Kit for such
a short time &amp; where to

put it, it is not worth getting
all taken to my house, he
would not consent and
told me to have it locked
in the drawers, only to let
Metty use my desk as
an office, I saw that it was
useless to argue with him
he would not consent~
left &amp; came home to breakfast
&amp; at 2 P.M. went on board,
I gave the Balance of money
of about 3,500 G.S.P. to Metty,
I put some of my Kit in
two small cases &amp; locked
&amp; nailed them up &amp; gave
the Key of my Cabin to Metty,
I left at 4 P.M. &amp; came
home so awfully tyred &amp;
Knocked down from the

barred muzzle loading gun)
and I started to Shoot,
walked in land down to as
far as Sheheil canal and
up, went as far as Khamasa,
I am sorry to see that there
are not so many Partridges
as I anticipated and besides
the great disappoîntment
in finding my cartridges which
I had loaded about 180 are
all bad, the powder being
very inferior &amp; the charge very
small, so that the shot went
off like a small Chinese
cracker with no force or
noise; so I missed 10 shots
&amp; only got 3 birds by the
time I returned to the Tent
at 10 1/4 , &amp; left Johny &amp; son
go toward Khamassa,
he came back at 111/2 with

more than a dozen &amp; only
got 3 birds; We rode for a
short time &amp; then walked
on, We put up a hare &amp; lost
it; At 10 we turned to come

back, I am missing awfully,
the cause is the bad cartridges
I have &amp; the shots very small,
By this time as we were crossing
many dry canals at Aweyin
a hare started between Johny
&amp; me coming on to pass us,
Johny fired &amp; shot it within
10 yards or less, &amp; the shots
must have struck the ground
&amp; bounded to an angle and
two shots struck me,
one with an awful force on the
bone just near the tale of my
right ear &amp; it bled, the other
on the right knee; but both
shots passed out, I had great
pain on my temple it only
required 1/8 of an Inch to
get into my eye; I went to
the bank &amp; washed with cold
water, the blood stopped,
At 12 we came to our Tent,
I had 10 partridges &amp; lost
3, Johny had 2 &amp; one Hare
