	Thanks be to God who made the dream a part of prophecy.  And blessings upon our master, Muhammad
the best of creatures, and upon his family and his companions who were led to the true faith
by Divine Guidance and attained eternal bliss.
	*Upon rubbing my face in the dust at the feet of your Lordship my fortune-blessed father. 
O my fortune’s blessing, in a dream your humble servant witnessed that a person was reciting 
the Qur’an in a loud voice. Because of this recitation, we were so overwhelmed by ecstasy that 
we nearly lost our mind. Our father and mother came and restrained us only with difficulty. 
Then we also witnessed that a woman had written the image of a moon on her breast. My sultan’s will be done.  
	*My fortune-blessed father, upon rubbing my face in the dust at your feet... In a dream 
one witnessed that we were reciting the Joseph Chapter (Sura Yūsuf) and interpreting it. In the part 
where Joseph’s brothers came to get wheat, while they were conversing with Joseph, he said, “go 
and bring my father.” And however many responses were talked about, I gave a response to each of them. 
My sultan’s will be done.
