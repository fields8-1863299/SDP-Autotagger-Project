room, but she did not like
the change; her fever is very
high again more than any
day 41??Cent. & is restless with
pain below the neck on the chest;

alarmed & weeping; She
wont take any milk or
other aliment~ at 4 she
felt more composing & drowsy.
She slept a little, she is getting
weak though;~ at 4 1/4
Nizam el Din came & examined
& tapped Cecile, he found that
all the organs are sound &
not affected the least, such
as the heart, liver, kidneys etc
except the seat of lung where
the pneumonia exists on one
side (the right), this proved
that the malady had not
been complicated or

Page 002:

affected any other part which
is a good sign, the temperature
of the fever is the same as
this morning Vg 40 1/4,
he prescribed the same medicine
as Ipecanuanha Ammonia etc
to be taken 3 times every 3
hours; Enima & friction as
usual & hopes that tomorrow
or the day after an ammilionatia
will be shown;~ But
Marie is mad & she began
to weep & got into an awful
state of mind; & nearly fainting
Dr. Nizam el Din tried very much
to assure her of Cecile's malady
not being serious & to calm
her down but to no use, She
would have him come again
at night time which he promised
to do so~ Towards 5 p.m.
Cecile was very calm and
the fever aborted & she slept
quietly;~ At 9 Dr Nizam el
Din came but he did see her
we sat in the siting room

asleep & reposed;

	My poor father
died from his complaint
at 1 3/4 o'clock
a.m. on Sunday morning
the 19th January 1908.

Page 040:
	Notes:
	
On the 18th January 1908 I
received early in the morning
a letter unfinished from
my father from his country
house telling me that
he feels bad with his sto-
mach ache, but he hopes
to be alright & came to town
on the 19th to visit some
friends with him, he also
tells me that mama &
Rafael have been to see
him. At the end of the
letter Rafail writes that
my father couldn't finish
his letter as he was very
bad & unable to write
since yesterday evening
& all the night he was
much troubled & I better
bring out a carriage to
carry him to town.

Page 041:
	Notes:
	
	At 8 a.m. the same day
I drove out by myself
& found my father very
weak & complaining from
intense ache & cramp of his
stomach & that he will never
be able to move & go to
town. However, with all our
possible I decided him
to move & helped him
to put on his clothes
& walked slowly to the
carriage with mama
Rafail, but poor papa
knew that his attack was
very severe this time & felt
awfully exhausted & when
leaving his country house
he bid farewell to every place
as if he knew it was for
the last time he is seeing them.
At 10 a.m. we reahed
my house in town & at

Page 042:
	Notes:
	
put papa in his room
which he had in my house.
He feels better for a while
& didn't accept to have
a doctor till sunset when
he asked for him. We sent
after Dr Nizameldin but he is
also sick & my father
feeling better we thought
that he is going to pass a
comfortable night.
Mama & Marie left
him to sleep at 9 p.m.,
but I insisted to sleep
in his room. From 9 1/2
to nearly midnight papa
was [underlined extremely] weasy &
tossing from a corner to an
other feeling his belly puffed
& at 11 1/2 p.m. asked me
to call mama as he feels 

Page 043:
	Notes:
	
very bad. Mama &
Marie came & saw him
terribly aching & feeling as his
stomach was cramped & the
wind (which was in reality the
sucking of his stomach caused
by the bursting of his ulcers)
going up & up to his heart.
He begged & asked for a
doctor so I sent & fetched
Dr. Zanko who arrived at
1 a.m. & as soon as he saw
my unfortunate father he
told me that he was dan
gerous & wanted the help
of another doctor after whom
we at once sent.
Dr Zanko gave papa
a big dose of citrate of
Magnesia in order to
evacuate the wind which
fearfully puffed up his

Page 044:
	Notes:
	
stomach, belly, breast &
throat & now his ears were
closed & couldn't hear well,
but his strength was alright
& he could speak till
1 1/2 a.m. He drunk the
dose twice, but the second
time he was suffocated
by the effervessing of the
medicine & fell on his
bed nearly unconscious.
We ran all to his
bed & the doctor declared
alas! that my poor beloved
papa was agonising & death
was near. We shivered
at this declaration & in
fact agony continued
till exactly 1 3/4 a.m.
when poor poor father

Page 045:
	Notes:
	
rendered his soul to
the Almighty his creature amid
our showers of fearful
tears & indescribable confusion
& heartrending!.....
	Two or three minutes
after his death a great quantity
of blood poured out from
his mouth caused by
the bursting of his ulcer
in his stomach causing
the fatal peritonitis!

After the unfortunate
death of my father
I should like to continue
here in his diary book
the most unfortunate

I saw all the doctors

medicines render me
worse & my state of health
is sinking daily. I do
not feel a local pain
but general easiness
& awful state of mind
added by my impossibility
to eat or drink any
nourishing aliments.
The crisis of my stomache
ache comes twice or thrice
