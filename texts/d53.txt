pay viz: G.S.P. 5700 as a
token of their appreciation
of your faithful service

	What a shame for the Company's
agents to remunerate an old
servant after 39 years service
to give him 50 ₤ and do away 
with him, It is all from
Henry Lynch, who has proved
himself already being for so
Stingy, but had I been an
English man, they would
have been certainly more
generous; they gave Captain
Clement’s wife (Alice) 200
₤ he had only been about
15 years in the service, and
to Mrs. Cowley 350 ₤ (for
5 years expences for his children
at school in Liverpool at
70 ₤ a year) and to Alfred
Holland 3 months’ pay
but he was only about
24 years in the service, and
his pay was higher than
mine ~ I see they have
also granted to my deceased

Page 139:
	Notes:

brother Henry’s wife also
a gratuity of 3 months’ pay
like me; It was my fault
for having asked in my letter,
for a grant of a few months’
pay as a gratification; had
I asked for an extention of three
months’ leave for the benefit
of my health I would have
got it, & then the few months
pay as a grant;

it was fetched back,
the golden load had been
gone & disappeared in such
a misterious way, that the
authorities have not yet been
able to trace it; of course
the government shall have to
pay the merchants their loss,
It is supposed that it is very
likely, it has been a preconserted
plot done by some military
officials, who are so much
in want of salaries, which
the governt. have not paid
them for a long time, & out of
revenge, & seeing the weakness
of the authority at present,
which gave them the chance
to do all they can to get money,
many other deeds of robbery
& plunder are taking place
The money belongs to H. Mahomed
Said Shahbender 650 TLiras,
Kerop Kouyoumjian 500 Liras,
Shukur & Ghazala 1400 Liras

the superior to explain to 
him all the matter & to

She opened her mouth as loud
as she could & asked me why 
I do not give the key to the Servant
I told her because I have no
more confidence in her &
she cryed most loudly and
impertinently why so, & what
has she stolen here, I said
you have been carrying
all your Kit away for the 
last 15 or 20 days, that you 
have already taken away 
three full boxes & five bundles
of her clothes, all the Silverware
of the house, she first denied
& then she said all belong
to her & I have nothing,
I said to her that she has 
even taken my whisky & 
sold it from the Kefeshkan 
at 2 ½ Rps by Rezooki
Towzira, I spoke too all
I could but I could feel
that I could not stand 
such a fearful raw

Page 245:

fearing for my stomach,
I told her that I will not let
her take anything away 
from her until I see it,
she was awfully impertinent 
and very unruly, she sung out
so loud that her throat got 
chocked, she called me every
thing in the shape of stingy,
ungrateful & so on; she came
then out of the room with a 
bundle, & I compelled her
to open & show it to me, she
opened it, & it contained some
silverware she said it was 
mortgaged to her, & her other
clothes & I let her have
them; she went away still
talking & assaulting me,
the servant carrying the 
bundle; Marie saw all
this scandal; & Alexander
before going to his office
she had also spoken very
roughly with him for 
an hour ~

	It is all through Tookye’s
coming to Baghdad that 
my wife has taken such
courage & liberty on me, as
she is always in her house,
and now as she is so jealous
of Mary her son's wife to
see her with her in the house,
& besides she has no more
any expences of the house,
it is all in my hand, as she
wished it to be so since
one year she used to tell me
of taking the expenses into
my hand & see how much
we spend & if the 10 TLiras
which I used to give her
will be sufficient, now
that I have taken it, & find
the expences below 10 Liras, 
I never had such a raw, or
quarrel before with my wife
and never saw her with such 
a courage, determination,

Page 247:
	
& with no shame, not the 
least consideration to me
as her husband, since our
marriage 25 years ago,
she seems to have made up
her mind to leave me for ever
by the tone of her talk & her
behavior; she is even intending
going to Basreh with her
daughter Tookyeh as she had 
told me after the latter's arrival,
	I became so enraged & vexed,
and even she had several times
thretened me by reporting
me to our consul Mr. Rappaport,
so at 10 I was determined to
get & see Mr. Rappaport & explain
to him all the matter from
beginning to end; He heard all
the story & was sorry for it
& he red me the rules and
duty of man & wife, & how a
wife cannot leave the house
or taken anything without
her husbands permission
& consent, & he advised me
to speak to a Priest or

to Père Pièrre so as to go and
talk to her & put her to reason,
& if I like he will offer himself
to do it, I prefered father
Peter for the present, & I 
left him; came home at 11,
	At 3 P.M. I called on my
niece Giuseppina the poor
widow she has become totally
blind since last year,
she also spoke to me about 
my wife as every house and
every Christian know it,
for the last month that she 
got angry & left me; I
then called on my niece
Louisa (wife of Yousif Yaghchi)
& then went to my sister
Medoola but she had gone 
to my house, I came and 
found her here, I related 
to her all what happened
to today ~ Shortly after
Père Pièrre called on us, he
had been to my sister Eliza

that Père Pièrre has been to

he spoke to my wife regarding
her quarrel with me, and
she said that she wants to 
go to Basreh with her daughter
when she goes but by my
consent, & she has nothing
with me etc, & he wishes to
see me at about 4 or 5
P.M. to talk to me;
	At 4 P.M. I called on Père Pièrre
in the Church, he told me that 
he asked my wife to come
over to see him yesterday, but
excused herself of being little
indisposed so he went to her
she complains to him that

my sisters are backing me
so as to be so had with her,
& that I have spoken very
harshly to her etc, without
obtaining any result, &
I got nothing materially from
Père Pièrre, & he said that
today she went to the 
Assyrian Bishop to speak to
him, & he sent for
Père Pièrre, the latter told
me that he would not have
gone there, considering that
my wife belongs to the Latin
creed, but for respect of
his position of being a Bishop
he went & he told him to
try & bring the matter to 
a reconciliation etc etc,
Père Pièrre asked me if he
can succeed to reconcile
us, would I like to come
to him & he will send 
for my wife also; I said
certainly not, I expect 
to see me wife coming

herself to my house and 
not before she fulfills the 
conditions, which I drew
out for him on paper in 
french, which is as follows 
	1st, The reconciliation
cannot be effected, but on 
the following conditions, 
	The restitution of 3 Boxes
taken away by her, as well 
as of 5 Bundles containing 
her effects, and silverware 
which belong to me and 
confided at her brother as 
well at her daughter, besides 
all the wines and spirits which
she has disposed of or sold
without having told me of 
it, In case of her denying, 
she shall have to be put 
on oath before a Revend Father,
	2 She shall have to obey
the orders and councels of her husband 
with regard to her absence 
from the house, and of her

	3 Before expressing to me
her regret of all what she had 
given me cause for offence, 
and of her bad conduct, It is quite 
impossible for me to allow 
my wife to voyage to Basreh 
for the sake of seeing her Sons, 
should I then permit her to
do so, it will be after the 
departure of her daughter from 
here, and that will only be 
for one month's absence; 
	Pere Pierre retained the above 
paper and found it reasonable,
He expressed his wish to have 
the matter settled as early as 
possible on account of Marie's 
approaching delivery & also 
not to cause a scandal 
among the Christians, I 
told him as for the first

to me whether she comes 
or not, but if she comes before 
our reconciliation, she will
be received only as visitress, 
and will not be permitted to 
have any ingress to the rooms 
or interfere with the business 
of the house; He then asked 
me that if she agrees to 
all the points and wishes to 
be reconciled, would i 
let him have Alexander 
to accompany him to his 
mother and bring her home? 
I said I will then do that 
with pleasure, and so I

	At 8 AM I called on Menusha
& at 10 left went to Alexander's
office & then came home at 10 ½, 
	Since the day before I have
heard from Alexander that
his mother intends going out
to Gherrarah on Sunday
(tomorrow) to spend a few
days with her daughter Takoohy
& her brother Antone, to me
she did not say anything,
nor asked me if I allow it,
and as I had tryed much
last week to ask Takoohy
to come to us for a few days
with her children so as to spend
it together, I begged of her
to come & she excused
herself on the plea that

Page 320:
	Notes:
	Margin Line 1:1902 Septr
	
she was too busy preparing
provisions etc for Basreh,  
perhaps she has got it still
in her heart the quarrel we 
had lately between her 
mother & myself (and it was
through Takoohy for being
in Baghdad & taken a
house for herself to which
my wife went as a place
of refuge) However this refusal
of Tookyeh annoyed me
and could see clear that she
does not want to come to
us, She asked me to send
her a Tent which I did &
sent her the new Bichoba
with its accessories etc as
I had nothing of ill feeling
to harbour in my hart then,
She wanted to come to see
us the day before she left 
for Gherrara, but before she
did so her mother went to
her instead & so prevented
her from coming, all this
added more to my vexation

Page 321:
	Notes:
	
& especially on seeing her
mother wanting to go out
to her so soon after Takooy’s
encamping so as to get
rid of us that is myself,
Alexander & Marie, and
spend the time there, as she
pleads for the benefit of her
health, when I have repeatedly
asked her if she like to go
out & encamp this year,
she always declined it, saying
that the preparation of Kitt
& provision etc is very fatiguing 
for her to support it herself 
alone; & now she wants to
go to her daughter by herself
& without asking me and
taking my consent and not
only this but she wants also
to go down to Basreh by the
end of next month with her
brother Antone; So I told
Alexander to tell her that
I shall not allow her to go
tomorrow to Gherrara without
my consent and also

Page 322:
	Notes:
	Margin Line 1:1902 Septr
	
because I had three times
asked Tookyeh to come to
our house & she declined,
and this shows that my
wife wants to do inspite of 
me; & to let her know that
I will be very angry, & if she
does it, she must know
that she shall not return
to my house again, he told
her so, & she was then very
furious, & spoke & quarrelled
with him & told him that
she shall go; She ordered
a young Lamb to be killed &
rosted to take out with
her tomorrow ~  at about
4 P.M. as I was going in to our
room to take a Bath, She
met me in the room & with a 
loud voice she said to me, 
“Why do you not want to let me
go out tomorrow to Gherrara
to my daughter,” I said “because
I would not let you go anywhere
without my consent either
to Gherrara or Basreh &

Page 323:
	Notes:

if you do it, you shall not 
come back to my house” She
became most furious and
savage & said that she shall
go & if I do not like it she
wants to separate from me
legally & finish once for all
as she can tolerate me no
longer & she cannot lead such
a miserable life, I said
I am quite ready to do it, if
you wish it so, & I know 
that [illegible] you cannot stay
at home as long as Marie
my son’s wife is here as you
detest her & have no love for
her; She said she wants
it now & I better go and
see the Priest Père Pièrre or
whomever I like to finish it 
between us, on this I left
quick & went to the Superior
Père Pièrre & related to him
the whole matter from the
beginning, He was astonished
and blamed her conduct
toward me very much &
asked me if I would allow

Page 324:
	Notes:
	Margin Line 1:1902 Sept
	
her to go out next week so
that she can have no more
excuse, I said I will if she
asks my consent; So he
left to go to talk to her & 
I went to Sister Medoola, and
I felt so vexed, trembling &
sorry, & was afraid that my
Stomach attack may come
on to me worse than ever,
	At 6 I went home & I asked
Alexander what had transpired 
he said that Père Pièrre spoke
to her so much but was all
to no use, & she told him that 
she has renounced going to
either Gherrara or Basreh,
& so Père Pièrre left her in
disgust & sorry for her not
coming to reason; She  
slept below in the big room 
& did not come to dinner
on the terrace; but I am only
sleeping up as it is so very
cold on the Terrace ~
	Modte N.W. wind & quite

him & Mr. Rappaort wanted
me to be reconciled; Père Pièrre
talked of my being rather severe on
the matter & that I should give in
& let my wife go out to her daughter
Takoohy at Gherrara & if I like
to accompany her too etc etc,
but I said that I am not severe,
I only want my wife to obey her
husband & not do things without
my knowledge & consent, and
that Takoohy had behaved badly
with me when I had gone three
times to her to beg to come 
& spend a few days with us,
& so I related all what took
place between us to Mr. Rappaport,
the latter was also siding with
Père Pièrre & wanted to see
us reconciled etc, they spoke
on the subject without knowing
the exact cause and bad
temper & behaviour of my
wife; Père Pièrre told me that
if he goes now & speaks to her
to persuade her to ask me
to let her go out to Gherrara

	I wrote a letter to Blockey
by today’s Damascus Post in 
answer to his of the 1st Jany ~ 
	The Russian Consul 
Mr. Grouglow what had gone
on leave of absence with his 
wife & children about [blank]
ago, came back here on the 
30 Ulto via Teheran and 
Kermanshah; his Chancellier 
Mr. Nofel (supposed originally
a Syrian of Beyrout & had gone 
to Russia & naturalized himself)
acted for him but he is of 
a very exentric character &
does foolish things that every one 
is loaghing at him; some 
three months ago, there happened
a quarrel at Kadumain between 
some Persians of Russian

nationality & natives of Kadumain
and he sent the Dragoman
Mr. Malcon Balthazar (an
Armenian who has been here for
the last 30 years just in the
telegraph office) to investigate
the case, and as the rumour 
was that both Nofel & Malcon
had been bribed by the culprits, 
& they quarelled, it appears that
Malcon insulted Nofel &
gave him cheeky answer to 
which Nofel also did & then 
discharged him from the 
service, after some days he 
wanted to imprison him in 
the Serai & denounced his 
protection, Malcon took
refuge at Kadem Pasha
his friend; As Mr. Grouglo 
had left Teheran, & had
wired to Malcon to send
to him his servant Monsoor
to meet him at Kermamshah

Page 476:
	Notes:
	Margin Line 1:1903 Feby
	Margin Line 5:[A53_476_05:233]

so Monsoor went at once, 
while the authorities were 
looking out for Malcon,
Kadem Pasha advised him 
to set out & go to meet Mr. 
Grouglo, & he facilitated
his escape, it was only 
known some 3 or 4 days later,
Malcon met Grouglo at Kermanshah
& related to him what passed
on his arrival her Grouglo went 
streight to Artin Awanessyan’s
house & put up there with his 
wife, children & Malcon,
& would not see Nofel, although 
the latter called twice to 
see him but was not admitted, 
	Lately about five days ago 
Grouglo went to the Consulate
to see Nofel & take over charge
of the archives & the Cypher Code
the latter demanded a receipt
for them & through which an 
altercation arose & insults
& Nofel said that he he went 
twice or three times to him but
was refused to be received

Page 477:
	Notes:
	Margin Line 6:[A53_477_06:234]

and Grouglo getting excited 
drew out his revolver & fired 
at Nofel, the latter also run
to get his revolver but was 
stopped by the Russian traveller 
& his wife (who are living 
in the Consulate on their way
down to the Gulf) the whole 
of them telegraphed to Constople 
to the Ambassador, an 
answer came, to the effect
that Mr. Adamoff the Russian 
Consul of Basreh has been 
ordered to come up to investigate 
the case, & a telegram to 
Mr. Rouet the french vice 
consul to look after Grouglow 
& watch his proceedings, 
& that Mr. Mashkow (who
was Consul here some 7 o 8
years ago & now appointed 
Consul General for Bushire)
is coming out, will decide 
the case; Mr. Adamoff is
coming up in the Mejidieh
& will be here tomorrow,
