      for Beyrout, I request him

      to wire to the Consul General
      <lb n="17"/>
      of Beyrout to furnish him
      <lb n="18"/>
      with a Passport~ He
      <lb n="19"/>
      wrote back to me, enclosing
      <lb n="20"/>
      the telegram, but he only
      <lb n="21"/>
      mentions my son's name
      <lb n="22"/>
      without that of his wife;
      <lb n="23"/>
      &amp; telling me that as he
      <lb n="24"/>
      does not know if he has
      <lb n="25"/>
      been married or not
      <lb n="26"/>
      <pb n="33"/>
      so as he would have got
      <lb n="1"/>
      her name included in the
      <lb n="2"/>
      Passport; I wrote back to
      <lb n="3"/>
      him at 6 P.M. saying that
      <lb n="4"/>
      as I wish to have the telegram
      <lb n="5"/>
      sent before Alexander's arrival
      <lb n="6"/>
      in Beyrout so as not to have
      <lb n="7"/>
      any difficulty with the Turkish
      <lb n="8"/>
      Authorities &amp; most likely that
      <lb n="9"/>
      he will get married in Beyrout
      <lb n="10"/>
      as I have written to Monseigneur
      <lb n="11"/>
      Altmayer in Mossul to
      <lb n="12"/>
      wire to Beyrout to Monseigneur
      <lb n="13"/>
      Duval to let him do so,
      <lb n="14"/>
      Therefore it would be better
      <lb n="15"/>
      if he can put in the telegram
      <lb n="16"/>
      that the Passport he made
      <lb n="17"/>
      out for either himself or
      <lb n="18"/>
      accompanied by his wife,
      <lb n="19"/>
      [space] I went home at 6 1/2 P.M.
      <lb n="20"/>
      &amp; soon after his Kawass came
      <lb n="21"/>
      to me saying that Mr. Rappaport
      <lb n="22"/>
      wishes to see me after an
      <lb n="23"/>
      hour or so~ I went at
      <lb n="24"/>
      7 1/2 but he was not at home
      <lb n="25"/>
      <pb n="34"/>
      so I went to my Sister Eliza
      <lb n="1"/>
      &amp; awaited there until he

      <lb n="3"/>
      up on the top of the house,
      <lb n="4"/>
      we spoke about the matter
      <lb n="5"/>
      &amp; so we found the best thing
      <lb n="6"/>
      is to leave the telegram now
      <lb n="7"/>
      until 5 or 6 days more
      <lb n="8"/>

      a letter from Alexander
      <lb n="21"/>
      dated Alexandria the 30 July.
      <lb n="22"/>
      he says that he was obliged
      <lb n="23"/>
      to go there from Port Said
      <lb n="24"/>
      in the same steamer he came
      <lb n="25"/>
      in from Brindisi the Bosforo

      <pb n="127"/>
      of the Rubatino Copy, without
      <lb n="1"/>
      paying any extra passage as

      he had the choice to go either
      <lb n="3"/>
      to P. Said or Alexandria &amp;
      <lb n="4"/>
      the cause of his going to Cairo
      <lb n="5"/>
      is that there are no steamers
      <lb n="6"/>
      going to Beyrout on account
      <lb n="7"/>
      of the quarantine &amp; that there
      <lb n="8"/>
      will be one of the Lloyed going
      <lb n="9"/>
      on the 10 or 12 Instant, so he
      <lb n="10"/>
      thought it would be better
      <lb n="11"/>
      to spend his time at Cairo
      <lb n="12"/>
      instead of P. Said, But
      <lb n="13"/>
      my wife is in a great enxiety

      on his way up last trip must

      have been a disentry, for he

      him to the Waly Namik
      <lb n="23"/>
      Pasha about my affair
      <lb n="24"/>
      of the house, I went
      <lb n="25"/>
      <pb n="235"/>
      him to outside the Custum
      <lb n="1"/>
      House where he had his
      <lb n="2"/>
      hired carriage, but as I
      <lb n="3"/>
      had not the Title deed
      <lb n="4"/>
      of the small house with me
      <lb n="5"/>
      I sent his Kawass home
      <lb n="6"/>
      &amp; brought it, while we were
      <lb n="7"/>
      waiting in the carriage
      <lb n="8"/>
      in Suk el Harrage &amp; we
      <lb n="9"/>
      then drove on to the Sarai
      <lb n="10"/>
      We went up to the Waly
      <lb n="11"/>
      he was by himself; he
      <lb n="12"/>
      speaks a little Arabic
      <lb n="13"/>
      sufficient to understand
      <lb n="14"/>
      he was very polite and
      <lb n="15"/>
      amiable (as I knew him
      <lb n="16"/>
      12 years ago when he had
      <lb n="17"/>
      gone down to Amara
      <lb n="18"/>
      as Inspector of the Sennyeh)
      <lb n="19"/>
      we spoke good deel about
      <lb n="20"/>
      Amara etc; then Mr.
      <lb n="21"/>
      Rappaport spoke to him
      <lb n="22"/>
      about the purchase of
      <lb n="23"/>
      <pb n="236"/>
      my little house 10 years
      <lb n="1"/>
      ago, &amp; I showed him the
      <lb n="2"/>
      Title deed, &amp; explained
      <lb n="3"/>
      to him how this man
      <lb n="4"/>
      called Emin is claiming
      <lb n="5"/>
      it as Wakuf, &amp; that
      <lb n="6"/>
      Yacoob (Pasha) Eassayi
      <lb n="7"/>
      is encouraging him to do
      <lb n="8"/>
      so etc etc; he said that
      <lb n="9"/>
      he knew this fellow Yacoob
      <lb n="10"/>
      Eassayi as a bad lot,
      <lb n="11"/>
      he was once a member
      <lb n="12"/>
      in the Mejlis but he
      <lb n="13"/>
      discharged him; he offered
      <lb n="14"/>
      to do all he can &amp; will
      <lb n="15"/>
      speak to the Judge about
      <lb n="16"/>
      the matter, &amp; he wanted
      <lb n="17"/>
      me to write it out the
      <lb n="18"/>
      matter in a sort of Petition
      <lb n="19"/>
      at once &amp; bring it to him
      <lb n="20"/>
      as today there is a Mejlis
      <lb n="21"/>
      &amp; the Kadi will be present
      <lb n="22"/>
      so I left Mr. Rappaport
      <lb n="23"/>
      <pb n="237"/>
      there, &amp; I hastened back
      <lb n="1"/>
      as quick as possible in
      <lb n="2"/>
      search of my Lawyer
      <lb n="3"/>
      Artin Sinan, after much
      <lb n="4"/>
      search I found him &amp;
      <lb n="5"/>
      we went to Yousif Yaghchi
      <lb n="6"/>
      in Asfar's Khan, and
      <lb n="7"/>
      I asked him to get me the
      <lb n="8"/>
      Petition written quick
      <lb n="9"/>
      before noon; but I saw
      <lb n="10"/>
      that this man is hasitating
      <lb n="11"/>
      and was in a fix and
      <lb n="12"/>
      showed abjections etc, at
      <lb n="13"/>
      last he told me plain
      <lb n="14"/>
      that he cannot now act
      <lb n="15"/>
      as my Lawyer on the ground
      <lb n="16"/>
      that he does possess
      <lb n="17"/>
      his Certificate of Lawyership
      <lb n="18"/>
      &amp; this has only been
      <lb n="19"/>
      revealed now, as the Order
      <lb n="20"/>
      has only been given by
      <lb n="21"/>
      <pb n="238"/>
      Authority two days ago,
      <lb n="1"/>
      &amp; therefore I must choose
      <lb n="2"/>
      an other Lawyer to defend
      <lb n="3"/>
      my claim; I was [strikethrough]
      <lb n="4"/>
      puzzled &amp; did not know
      <lb n="5"/>
      what to do, &amp; the time
      <lb n="6"/>
      is passing; at last we
      <lb n="7"/>
      went to Kewark Setyan
      <lb n="8"/>
      (the brother of Kirikor whom we
      <lb n="9"/>
      have on board as Engineer
      <lb n="10"/>
      Apprentice &amp; the other brother
      <lb n="11"/>
      is Kapriel whom we saw
      <lb n="12"/>
      in Paris in 1897) to this
      <lb n="13"/>
      man I explained the matter
      <lb n="14"/>
      &amp; he wrote the Petition out
      <lb n="15"/>
      in the name of my wife
      <lb n="16"/>
      (as the Title deed is in her
      <lb n="17"/>
      name) I went &amp; fetched
      <lb n="18"/>
      her seal also 2 G.S.P. for
      <lb n="19"/>
      stamps &amp; I took it at 11
      <lb n="20"/>
      and hastened back to
      <lb n="21"/>
      the Waly (Mr. Rappaport
      <lb n="22"/>
      had gone) I gave it
      <lb n="23"/>
      <pb n="239"/>
      to him &amp; sat down, he red
      <lb n="1"/>
      it &amp; found it right, he
      <lb n="2"/>
      then wrote on the back
      <lb n="3"/>
      of it to the Tapo Officials
      <lb n="4"/>
      to find out the registration
      <lb n="5"/>
      of the Title deed in their
      <lb n="6"/>
      Books, I then left and
      <lb n="7"/>
      walked away at 11 ¾
      <lb n="8"/>
     </p>
     <p>
      	I called in the Office to
      <lb n="9"/>
      Mr. Bottomley; he told
      <lb n="10"/>
      me that I should make up the balance
      <lb n="11"/>
      in the Cash Book &amp; give the rest of
      <lb n="12"/>
      the money to Metty to continue
      <lb n="13"/>
      entering every thing in the Cash
      <lb n="14"/>
      Book instead of writing it on
      <lb n="15"/>
      a separate paper; and also
      <lb n="16"/>
      to give him my Cabin to
      <lb n="17"/>
      use as an office &amp; not to lock
      <lb n="18"/>
      it up &amp; take the Key, as if
      <lb n="19"/>
      some accident or fire occurrs
      <lb n="20"/>
      the Cabin will be locked,
      <lb n="21"/>
      I told him how can I take
      <lb n="22"/>
      away all my Kit for such
      <lb n="23"/>
      a short time &amp; where to
      <lb n="24"/>
      <pb n="240"/>
      put it, it is not worth getting
      <lb n="1"/>
      all taken to my house, he
      <lb n="2"/>
      would not consent and
      <lb n="3"/>
      told me to have it locked
      <lb n="4"/>
      in the drawers, only to let
      <lb n="5"/>
      Metty use my desk as
      <lb n="6"/>
      an office, I saw that it was
      <lb n="7"/>
      useless to argue with him
      <lb n="8"/>
      he would not consent~
      <lb n="9"/>
      left &amp; came home to breakfast
      <lb n="10"/>
      &amp; at 2 P.M. went on board,
      <lb n="11"/>
      I gave the Balance of money
      <lb n="12"/>
      of about 3,500 G.S.P. to Metty,
      <lb n="13"/>
      I put some of my Kit in
      <lb n="14"/>
      two small cases &amp; locked
      <lb n="15"/>
      &amp; nailed them up &amp; gave
      <lb n="16"/>
      the Key of my Cabin to Metty,
      <lb n="17"/>
      I left at 4 P.M. &amp; came
      <lb n="18"/>
      home so awfully tyred &amp;

      as I anticipated and besides
      <lb n="12"/>
      the great disappoîntment

      in finding my cartridges which
      <lb n="14"/>
      I had loaded about 180 are
      <lb n="15"/>
      all bad, the powder being
      <lb n="16"/>
      very inferior &amp; the charge very
      <lb n="17"/>
      small, so that the shot went
      <lb n="18"/>
      off like a small Chinese
      <lb n="19"/>
      cracker with no force or
      <lb n="20"/>
      noise; so I missed 10 shots
      <lb n="21"/>
      &amp; only got 3 birds by the

      10 yards or less, &amp; the shots
      <lb n="9"/>
      must have struck the ground
      <lb n="10"/>
      &amp; bounded to an angle and
      <lb n="11"/>
      two shots struck me,

      bone just near the tale of my
      <lb n="14"/>
